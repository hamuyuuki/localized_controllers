Description:
    Stubs out a new localized controller and its views. Pass the controller name,
    either CamelCased or under_scored, the locale name and a list of views as
    arguments.

    To create a localized controller within a module, specify the controller name
    as a path like 'parent_module/controller_name'.

    This generates a localized controller class in app/controllers and template
    engine.

Example:
    `rails generate localized_controllers LocalizableResources en index show`

    LocalizableResourcesEn controller with URLs like /localizable_resources.
        Controller: app/controllers/localizable_resources_en_controller.rb
        Views:      app/views/localizable_resources/index.en.html.erb [...]
